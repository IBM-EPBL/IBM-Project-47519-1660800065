Project Name	Project - Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction
Maximum Marks	2 Marks

Proposed Solution Template:
Project team shall fill the following information in proposed solution template.
S.No.	Parameter	Description
		Problem Statement (Problem to be solved)	Farmers' conventional methods of agricultural cultivation are ineffective. It does not make proper use of all available resources. Farmers are unable to detect crop diseases due to a lack of knowledge and old practices, which often result in soil nutrient deterioration and exhaustion. As a result, crop failure occurs. Growing only certain crops depletes the soil,and if the crops are harmed by illnesses, farmers are uninformed of how to recover such crops. Food needs cannot be met until and unless efficient resource management and use is implemented.
		Idea / Solution description	The best fertilizer for crop to prevent and cure disease efficiently .
		Novelty / Uniqueness 	The best fertilizer among other fertilizer which is adoptable to the crops.
		Social Impact / Customer Satisfaction	provides more immunity to the crop and prevents from diseases.
		Business Model (Revenue Model)	Fertilizer recommendation system for disease predicition.
		Scalability of the Solution	frequently used and efficient fertilizer to control or trace the disease and amount to be used.
